**Twitter Sentiment Analysis**   
This project is a web-based application that performs sentiment analysis on tweets using the TextBlob library. The app is built with Streamlit, making it easy to use and interact with.

**How It Works**   
1. Tweet Input: Enter a keyword or hashtag in the search bar to fetch relevant tweets.
2. Sentiment Analysis: The app uses the TextBlob library to analyze the sentiment of each tweet. It classifies the sentiment into three categories:

  -  Positive: The tweet expresses a positive sentiment.
  -  Negative: The tweet expresses a negative sentiment.
  -  Neutral: The tweet is neutral, neither positive nor negative.
3. Visualization: The app displays the results in a simple and easy-to-understand format, including charts and statistics.

**Libraries Used**
- Streamlit: For building the web-based interface.
- TextBlob: For performing sentiment analysis on tweets.
- Tweepy: For fetching tweets from Twitter (optional if using stored datasets).
